filtered_gps_dataset.gpkg - above dataset after filtering and conversion to gpkg.
filtered_gps_dataset.gpkg - the above dataset after addition of habitat data.
Rock Dove, Jezierski&Smith, Outer Hebrides(1).csv - data for ctmm in Movebank standard format.
roost_sites.gpkg - the shape file of roost sites in the study system.

Files: British_Isles_map.gpkg; clachan_base.gpkg; clachan_habitat.gpkg; clachan_new_habitat.gpkg; sat_map_clachan.Rdata are not shared as we are not owners of the original data used for them.
